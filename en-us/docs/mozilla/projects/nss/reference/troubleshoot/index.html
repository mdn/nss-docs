 <li>Having /usr/ucb/bin in the path before /usr/ccs/bin breaks the build on 64-bit Solaris.</li>
 <li>The Solaris compiler needs to be workshop-5.0 or greater.</li>
 <li>The 64-bit builds don't support gcc.</li>
 <li>If the build fails early on the gmakein coreconf try updating your cvs tree with -P:<br>
  <br>
  cd mozilla<br>
  cvs update -P</li>
 <li>Building a 32-bit version on a 64-bit may fail with:
  <pre class="notranslate">/usr/include/features.h:324:26: fatal error: bits/predefs.h: No such file or directory

</pre>
  <p>In this case remember to set USE_64=1</p>
 </li>

Kernel data structures may remain allocated for these connections for up to two minutes. Some systems may not be configured to allow this many simultaneous connections by default; if the stress tests fail, try increasing the number of simultaneous sockets supported.</p></div><h3 id="building_jss"><a href="#building_jss" title="Permalink to Building JSS">Building JSS</a></h3><div><ul>
 <li><b>Windows Only:</b> The shell invoked by gmake, <code>shmsdos.exe</code>, is likely to crash when invoking some Java tools on Windows. The current workaround is to use some other shell in place of <code>shmsdos</code>, such as <code>sh.exe</code>, which should be distributed with the <a href="http://sourceware.cygnus.com/cygwin/download.html" class="external" rel=" noopener">Cygnus toolkit</a> you installed to build NSS. The change is unfortunately rather drastic: to trick gmake, you rename the shell program.
  <blockquote>
   cd c:/Programs/cygnus/bin
   <i>
    (or wherever your GNU tools are installed)</i>
   <br>
   cp shmsdos.exe shmsdos.bak
   <i>
    (backup shmsdos)</i>
   <br>
   cp sh.exe shmsdos.exe
   <i>
    (substitute alternative shell)</i>
  </blockquote>
  Making this change will probably break other builds you are&nbsp; making on the same machine. You may need to switch the shell back and forthdepending on which product you are building. We will try to provide a moreconvenient solution in the future. If you have the MKS toolkit installed,&nbsp; the &lt;tt&gt;sh.exe&lt;/tt&gt; that comes with this toolkit can be used as well.</li>
