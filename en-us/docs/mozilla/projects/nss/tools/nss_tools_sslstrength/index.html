<h4 id="restricting_ciphers">Restricting Ciphers</h4>
<p>By default, sslstrength assumes that all the preferences are on, so it will use any preferences in your policy. The enabled ciphersuites will always be printed out before the connection is made. If you want to test out a particular cipher, there are two ways to affect which ciphers are available. Firstly, you can set <b>policy</b> to be either domestic or export. This restricts the available ciphers to the same set used by Communicator. In addition to this, the <b>ciphers</b> command can be used to further restrict the ciphers available. The argument to the ciphers command is a string of characters, where each single character represents a cipher. You can obtain this list of character-&gt;cipher mappings by doing 'sslstrength ciphers'. For example,</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ciphers=bfi</b> will turn on these cipher preferences and turn off all others.</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; policy=export</b> or <b>policy=domestic</b> will set your policies appropriately.</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; policy</b> will default to domestic if not specified.<br>
  &nbsp;</p>
<h4 id="step-up">Step-up</h4>
<p>Step up is a mode where the connection starts out with 40-bit encryption, but due to a 'change-cipher-spec' handshake, changes to 128-bit encryption. This is only done in 'export mode', with servers with a special certificate. You can tell if you stepped-up, because the output will says 'using export policy', and you'll find the secret key size was 128-bits.</p></div><h3 id="prerequisites"><a href="#prerequisites" title="Permalink to Prerequisites">Prerequisites</a></h3><div><p>You should have a cert7.db in the directory in which you run sslstrength.<br>
